# DPLA transformations

To support basic inclusions of materials in the Digial Public Library of America, we must disseminate a METS record representing a collection and for each included item, the MODS records should contain URLs for the object in context, the thumbnails and a large version of the image file.

These transformations are used in a service deployment for the uva-lib:modsSDef and uva-lib:metsSDef.
